GDP Data Analysis for Indian States

# Indian States Economic Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the economic and social factors affecting the GDP of Indian states. The analysis covers several key aspects:

- Exports
- GDP trends over the past decade
- Literacy rates
- Unemployment rates
- Access to electricity
- Availability of safe drinking water

## Key Findings

1. **Exports**: States with higher export volumes (e.g., Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu) show robust GDP figures.

2. **GDP Growth**: 
   - High growth states: Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Gujarat
   - Low growth states: Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Assam

3. **Literacy Rate**: Higher literacy rates often correlate with higher GDP (e.g., Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu).

4. **Unemployment Rate**: 
   - Low unemployment states (e.g., Gujarat, Karnataka) contribute to higher GDP
   - High unemployment states (e.g., Kerala, Jammu & Kashmir) face challenges despite other positive factors

5. **Electricity Access**: Well-electrified states (e.g., Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat) show better industrial growth and higher GDP.

6. **Safe Drinking Water**: States with better access (e.g., Kerala, Punjab, Haryana) show improved health and productivity, contributing to higher GDP.

## Conclusions

- Exports are significant drivers of GDP growth
- There's a clear correlation between literacy rates and economic growth
- Unemployment negatively impacts GDP
- Infrastructure (electricity and water access) is crucial for economic development
- Significant regional disparities exist in GDP growth among states

## Policy Recommendations

1. Enhance education and skill development
2. Invest in infrastructure (electricity and water)
3. Promote exports through targeted policies
4. Implement job creation programs

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on data including:
- Export volumes
- GDP figures over the past decade
- Literacy rates
- Unemployment rates
- Electricity access statistics
- Safe drinking water availability data
